WARNING: THE TESTS MESS WITH YOUR SETTINGS

Some of the things the testsuite does:

- Repeatedly kill all network connections
- Delete, modify and add network connections
- Change your hostname

Think twice before you want to run this testsuire. And read the tests to see
what they do.

The following tests are safe to run, as they only read data:

test_accesspoint.py
test_activeconnection.py
test_devices.py
test_ipconfig.py
